# freecellsolver
go practice: a free cell solitaire solver

1. DFS
2. Best First Match with min-heap and tree
3. Multi-Threading Best First Match, using Mutex to create thread-safe min-heap.
(Tried using channel to create a wait list, much slower.)

python part is mainly template matching and mouse action.
